## Setup Guide

1. Install [virtual box](https://www.virtualbox.org/).
2. Install [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/).
3. Read the [homestead doc page](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/homestead)
4. Setup Homestead environment
5. Now clone the repo for the starter kit
``` 
git clone https://github.com/phptuts/starterkitforsymfony.git
```
6. Go into your Homestead.yml file and add a site to match where you cloned the repo.  Mine looks like this.
``` 
folders:
    - map: ~/vagrant/code
      to: /home/vagrant/Code

sites:
    - map: exmaple.app
      to: /home/vagrant/Code/Symfony/SymfonyStart/web
      type: symfony2
```
7. Also add a database to your config
``` 
databases:
    - homestead
    - skfsp
```
8. vagrant up and then do a vagrant provision in the homestead folder.
9. vagrant ssh to ssh into the vagrant box.
10. cd into the directory where your project is
11. create a jwt directory in your var folder
``` 
mkdir var/jwt
```
12. create your private key with and write down the pass phrase you used.
``` 
openssl genrsa -out var/jwt/private.pem -aes256 4096
```
13. create your public key, you will need the pass phrase here and in the composer install step
``` 
openssl rsa -pubout -in var/jwt/private.pem -out var/jwt/public.pem
```
14. Run  composer install
15. Composer will ask for all the stuff you setup in the pre steps + jwt pass phrase & database info.  Homestead root 
password stuff is below.  You can always change this in the parameters.yml, fyi.
here:
``` 
    app.database_user: homestead
    app.database_password: secret
    app.database_name: skfsp ## or whatever you named it in the config
```
16. run migrations and this data fixtures script to load a default user.

``` 
   bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate

   bin/console doctrine:fixtures:load --fixtures="./src/AppBundle/DataFixtures/ORM/LoadStartUserData.php"
```
17. Delete the .git folder
```
    rm -rf .git
```

You should then have the website setup.  The user to login is:

email: admin@not-real-domain.com /
password: password

Then your done if you have any questions just ask!!! :)
