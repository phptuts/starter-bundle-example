## Auto Generated Documentation

We use the[NelmioApiDocBundle](https://github.com/nelmio/NelmioApiDocBundle) to auto generate docs for us.  It will parse all of our routing annotations and produce a document that lets people test drive our application.

### Config

What this does is say that for the api we using Authorization header with a token prefixed with bearer for our authentication.  In the top right corner you will see a place to enter that that token so you don't have to do it on every request.  It also say that by default send all the requests as json.

```
nelmio_api_doc:
    name: 'Symfony Starter Api'
    sandbox:
        authentication:
            name: Authorization
            delivery:  http
            type: bearer
        body_format:
            formats: [json, form]
            default_format: json

```

To document an end point you only need the ApiDoc annonation.   Here is an example.

```
     * @ApiDoc(
     *  resource=true,
     *  description="Get's a user",
     *  section="Users",
     *  authentication=true
     * )
```
