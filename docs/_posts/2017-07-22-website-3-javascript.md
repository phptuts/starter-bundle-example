### A brief note on javascript

Right now we only use jquery and jquery plugins to load javascript.  Most fo the javascript is written in twig and is kept really really simple.  The only exception to this is the [fileupload js](https://github.com/phptuts/starterkitforsymfony/blob/8980e71e56e401934843d74e7abc07d0c18bb54e/web/assets/js/file-upload-bootstrap.js) which is in the web folder.  All js libraries are loaded with CDNs.
